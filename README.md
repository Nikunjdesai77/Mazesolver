# Mazesolver 🧩

Welcome to the **Mazesolver** repository!  
This project is all about solving mazes as part of a DM (Decision Making/Data Mining) project, using a mix of **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Flask**, **CSS**, and **HTML**.

---

## 🧠 About

Mazesolver demonstrates various algorithms and techniques for maze generation and pathfinding.  
It combines interactive web visualization (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) with robust backend computations (Python with Flask) for a hands-on experience.

The core logic is based on **MATRIX Path algorithms**, enabling efficient and flexible maze exploration.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive maze creation and visualization
- Multiple maze-solving algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, A*, Dijkstra)
- **Matrix Path as the base algorithm**
- Step-by-step pathfinding animations
- Customizable maze size and complexity
- Statistics and performance comparison between algorithms
- Responsive web interface for easy use
- Python Flask backend for algorithm execution and API endpoints

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **JavaScript** – Frontend logic and visualization
- **Python** & **Flask** – Backend computation, algorithm implementation, REST API
- **HTML & CSS** – Structure and styling

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikunjdesai77/Mazesolver.git
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

```bash
cd Mazesolver
pip install flask
```

You may also have a `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the Flask server
```bash
python app.py
```
The Flask server will run locally (usually on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).  
This serves the backend API for maze-solving logic and interacts with the frontend.

### 4. Run the Web App
- Open `index.html` in your browser for the JavaScript visualization.
- The frontend communicates with the Flask backend to solve mazes using MATRIX Path and other algorithms.

### 5. Explore and Experiment
- Modify maze parameters and try different algorithms.
- Visualize results and compare efficiency.

## 📝 Usage

- Select maze size and shape in the UI
- Choose an algorithm (including MATRIX Path) to solve the maze
- Watch the solution in real-time
- Analyze stats and compare different approaches
